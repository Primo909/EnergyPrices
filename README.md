# EnergyPrices
Dashboard that predicts energy prices in some Balkan countries: Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece.

Run dashboard with command

```bash
$ python3 code/app.py
```

## Possible Errors 
It might be necessary to use a virtual environment (venv) to have the correct version of the needed packeges. A requirements.txt is provided in the base folder. To set up the venv execute the commands

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
```

From there you should be able to run the dashboard without errors.
